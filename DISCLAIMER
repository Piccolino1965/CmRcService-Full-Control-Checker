This software is provided **for informational, auditing, and defensive purposes only**.

The CmRcService Full Control Checker is designed to help system administrators, security teams, auditors, and compliance officers **understand and document** how Microsoft Endpoint Configuration Manager (MECM/SCCM) Remote Control is being used on a Windows system, based on existing client-side logs.

It **does not bypass security controls**, does not enable surveillance, and does not perform any remote access or monitoring activities by itself.  
It only reads log files that already exist on the system.

The author assumes **no responsibility** for any misuse of this tool, including but not limited to:
- Use without proper authorization
- Use in violation of local laws, labor regulations, or internal company policies
- Use for employee surveillance or disciplinary purposes without a valid legal and organizational framework

Before using this tool, ensure that:
- You are authorized to access the target system and its logs
- The use of log analysis complies with applicable laws (e.g. labor law, privacy regulations, GDPR)
- The activity is aligned with internal governance, security, and compliance policies

By using this software, you acknowledge that **responsibility for its use lies entirely with the user**.
