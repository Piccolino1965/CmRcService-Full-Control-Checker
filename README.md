# CmRcService-Full-Control-Checker

# CmRcService Full Control Checker (MECM / SCCM)

A Windows-oriented Python script that analyzes the **CmRcService** log generated by Microsoft Endpoint Configuration Manager (MECM/SCCM) Remote Control, looking for sessions granted with **Full Control** permissions.

It prints a summary to the console and generates two artifacts (report + evidence) in the same folder as the analyzed log.

## What it does

The script searches the standard MECM client log folder:

`C:\Windows\CCM\Logs`

It looks for the string:

- `Session allowed: Full Control`

It also includes a tolerance for the common typo:

- `Session allowed: Full Controll`

For every match, it extracts context lines around the hit and tries to capture useful fields typically present in the same log block, such as:

- Timestamp (parsed from `date="..."` and `time="..."`)
- Incoming connection IP and port
- Viewer address
- Host address
- Authorized viewer user (when present)

---

## Output files

When matches are found, the script produces:

- `report_CmRcService_full_control.txt`  
  A compact, human-friendly summary of all detected events.

- `evidence_CmRcService_full_control.log`  
  Raw evidence blocks with surrounding lines for each event, suitable for archiving, sharing internally, or attaching to a ticket.

Both files are written into the same directory where the CmRcService log is located.

## Requirements

- Windows machine with MECM/SCCM client logs available
- Python 3.x
- Administrative privileges are typically required to access `C:\Windows\CCM\Logs`

No external Python packages are needed (standard library only).

## How to run

Open a terminal (PowerShell or CMD) as Administrator and run:

```bash
python CmRcService_full_control_checker.py
